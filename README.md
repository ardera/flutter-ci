# flutter engine binaries for armv7, aarch64, x64

This repo contains flutter engine binaries (in the https://github.com/ardera/flutter-engine-binaries-for-arm filesystem layout) for armv7 and aarch64.
The binaries come in 2 variants: generic, and tuned for the Pi 4 CPU.

# üõ†Ô∏è Build Config and Compiler Invocation
## Build Config
The engine build is configured with: [^2]
```
$ ./src/flutter/tools/gn \
  --runtime-mode <debug / profile / release> \
  [--unoptimized]
  --target-os linux \
  --linux-cpu <arm / arm64 / x64> \
  [--arm-float-abi hard] \
  --target-dir build \
  --embedder-for-target \
  --disable-desktop-embeddings \
  --no-build-glfw-shell \
  --no-build-embedder-examples \
  --no-goma
```

After that, the following args are added to the `args.gn` file for armv7/aarch64 without any CPU-specific tuning:
```
arm_cpu = "generic"
arm_tune = "generic"
```

When tuning for pi 3:
```
arm_cpu = "cortex-a53"
arm_tune = "cortex-a53"
```

When tuning for pi 4:
```
arm_cpu = "cortex-a72+nocrypto"
arm_tune = "cortex-a72"
```

For both armv7 and aarch64, the engine is built against the sysroot provided by the engine build scripts, which is some debian sid sysroot from 2020.
(See https://github.com/flutter/buildroot/blob/master/build/linux/sysroot_scripts/install-sysroot.py)

## Compiler Invocation
This will result in the clang compiler being invoked with the following args:

| artifact        | compiler arguments                                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| armv7-generic   | `--target=armv7-linux-gnueabihf    -mcpu=generic             -mtune=generic`    |
| pi4             | `--target=armv7-linux-gnueabihf    -mcpu=cortex-a72+nocrypto -mtune=cortex-a72`[^1] |
| pi3             | `--target=armv7-linux-gnueabihf    -mcpu=cortex-a53          -mtune=cortex-a53` |
| aarch64-generic | `--target=aarch64-linux-gnu        -mcpu=generic             -mtune=generic`    |
| pi4-64          | `--target=aarch64-linux-gnu        -mcpu=cortex-a72+nocrypto -mtune=cortex-a72`[^1] |
| pi3-64          | `--target=aarch64-linux-gnu        -mcpu=generic             -mtune=generic` |
| x64-generic     | `--target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -mcpu=generic             -mtune=generic` |

## Debug Symbols

Some modifications are made to the engine build scripts so it's always built with `-ggdb -fdebug-default-version=4`.
The debug symbols are then split into a separate file using:
```bash
$ objcopy --only-keep-debug libflutter_engine.so libflutter_engine.so.dbgsyms
$ objcopy --strip-debug libflutter_engine.so
$ objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=libflutter_engine.{debug/profile/release/debug_unopt}.dbgsyms libflutter_engine.so
```

That means you can just later download the debug symbols when you need them and step through the engine source code.

However, the resulting `libflutter_engine.so` is ~4MBs larger than one that has _all_ (not only debug symbols) stripped.
So, if you want to save a few more megabytes you can strip them using:
```bash
objcopy --strip-unneeded libflutter_engine.so
```

[^1]: The CPU of the Raspberry Pi 4 is a Cortex-A72. `+nocrypto` is specified for `-mcpu` because the A72 in the Pi 4 is (_apparently_) the only A72 in the world that doesn't support cryptography instructions: https://github.com/ardera/flutter-ci/issues/3#issuecomment-1272330857

[^2]: `--arm-float-abi hard` is only specified when building for armv7, `--unoptimized` is only specified for unoptimized debug builds.
